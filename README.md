## Results
Logistic Regression Model 1 performed well in predicting low-risk loans, achieving 100% precision and recall, but had a slightly lower precision (87%) and recall (89%) for high-risk loans. Overall, the model achieved an accuracy of 94%.
On the other hand, Logistic Regression Model 2 showed even better performance, maintaining 100% precision and recall for both low-risk and high-risk loans. The accuracy of this model was 100%, indicating that it correctly classified all the instances in the dataset.
Both models demonstrated high precision, which means that when they predicted a loan as low-risk or high-risk, they were usually correct. Model 2, however, outperformed Model 1 in terms of accuracy and recall, making it the better-performing model for this task.
## Summurry 
The first Logistic Regression model, trained on the original data, demonstrates exceptional performance in predicting 'healthy loans' with accuracy, precision, and recall reaching close to 100%. However, it faces challenges when it comes to identifying 'high-risk loans,' exhibiting a precision of 85% and a recall of 91%. This disparity suggests that the model is less proficient in classifying high-risk loans compared to healthy ones. The skewed nature of the provided data, with only about 3 percent of the sample representing high-risk loans, likely contributes to this limitation.
In contrast, the second Logistic Regression model, which uses resampled data, exhibits notable improvements in identifying both 'healthy loans' and 'high-risk loans.' Its precision, recall, and accuracy rates are consistent across the board. Given the potential high costs associated with misidentifying and lending money to a 'high-risk loan' applicant, while the misidentification of a 'healthy loan' applicant incurs minimal cost, the heightened accuracy of the second model in detecting 'high-risk loans' makes it the recommended choice. Although the first model may perform slightly better at identifying 'healthy loan' applicants, this aspect is of lesser importance compared to the crucial task of accurately identifying 'high-risk loan' applicants, which the second model accomplishes more effectively.
