## Overview of the Analysis 
The primary objective of this analysis is to build a robust model capable of accurately distinguishing between 'healthy loan' and 'high-risk loan' applicants based on specific application factors such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, pre-defined derogatory marks, and total debt. Subsequently, we will thoroughly evaluate and test the performance of this model to determine its effectiveness in classifying applicants into these two distinct categories.
The analysis took into account the following data: 1. Loan amount; 2.Interest rate of the loan;           3.Borrower's income; 4.Debt-to-income ratio; 5.Number of accounts held by the borrower; 6.Presence of derogatory marks against the borrower; 7.Total debt amount.
The dataset consisted of 77,536 data points, which were split into training and testing sets. In the training set, an initial logistic regression model (Logistic Regression Model 1) was constructed using the LogisticRegression module from the scikit-learn library. The aim of this model was to predict whether a loan to a borrower in the testing set would be classified as low-risk or high-risk. The class distribution in the original dataset was imbalanced, with 75,036 low-risk loan data points and only 2,500 high-risk data points.
To address the class imbalance, the training set data was resampled using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library. This resampling process created a balanced dataset containing 56,277 data points for both low-risk (class 0) and high-risk (class 1) loans, based on the original dataset.
The resampled data was then used to build a new logistic regression model (Logistic Regression Model 2). The primary objective of Logistic Regression Model 2 remained the same, which was to predict the risk category (low-risk or high-risk) of loans for borrowers in the testing set. The results of this new model are summarized below.
